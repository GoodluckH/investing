## Investment Notes
Why not open-source my investment research process? While it's unclear how many GitHub users are hard-core fundamental investors, I thought it would be beneficial to publish my investment ideas through GitHub because developers are probably not frequent vistors to some investor online communities.


I will continue to add on to this repo, so feel free to rank fork it out if you have additional insights or interest in companies that I'm researching.
